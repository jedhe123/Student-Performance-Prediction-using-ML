# Student-Performance-Prediction-using-ML #

To develop a machine learning-based application that predicts student academic performance using input features like Name, Age, Gender, Area of Living, Extracuricular Activities, 10th Marks, 12th Marks, Attendance, previous CGPA, and study hours.

## Introduction

Student performance prediction involves using machine learning algorithms to analyze student data and predict their future academic performance. This data can include demographics, academic history (grades, test scores), attendance records, participation levels, and even engagement with online learningÂ platforms.

**Note: This Project is for Educational Purposes Only**

The Student Exam Performance Predictor project is developed for educational purposes to showcase the application of machine learning techniques in predicting student performance. The results obtained from this project are based on a specific dataset and machine learning model, and should not be considered as definitive or accurate predictions for real-world scenarios. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the end-to-end process of developing a machine learning model and provide insights into the factors influencing student performance.

## Objectives

- The goal of this project is to create a software system that can understand and predict student performance using the given data. 
- To create a Software model that can predict student performance. 
- To help teachers and schools make better decisions. 

## Technologies used

 Frontend:
      HTML, CSS, JavaScript
 Backend:
      Node.js
 Libraries:
      Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
 Machine Learning:
       Linear Regression, Decision Trees.
  Tools:
       VS Code

## Usage

1. Run the application: `python app.py`
2. Access the web interface in your browser at `http://localhost:5000`
3. Fill in the student information and submit the form to obtain the predicted graphical representation.

## Model Training

The machine learning model is trained using a supervised learning algorithm, such as a decision tree and linear regression, to predict the graphical representation based on the input features. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
